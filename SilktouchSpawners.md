## Silk Touch Spawners
This data pack allows using a silk touch pickaxe to pick up mob spawners.

### Functionality
- When breaking mob spawners with regular (non-silk touch) tools, the behavior of the game is not affected; the mob spawner will break, and drop exp if mined with a pickaxe.
- When breaking mob spawners with a silk touch pickaxe, no exp is dropped, and instead the spawner item is dropped.
- When placed in the overworld, the spawner will spawn zombies, skeletons, or spiders (one will be randomly chosen during placement)
- When placed in the nether, the spawner will spawn blazes.
- When placed in the end, the spawner will spawn endermen.
