## Ender XP Storage
This data pack allows storing XP in an Ender Chest. To prevent abuse and reduce micro-management of XP, a percentage of stored XP is lost.

### Storing XP
Players can store XP by standing on an Ender Chest and looking straight down. XP is stored at the following ratios, based on how much XP is currently stored in the chest:  

| Levels worth of XP in Ender Chest | Percentage lost during storage |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Up to ~30 Levels                  | 20% Lost                       |
| ~30 to ~40 Levels                 | 40% Lost                       |
| More than ~40 Levels              | 60% Lost                       |
