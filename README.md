## Goals
### âœ… DO
#### **Reduce scarcity of certain items in relation to number/activity of players**
As more players spend more time on a server, loot (from temples, one-time-spawn mobs, ruins, etc) because more-and-more difficult to find, and players are forced to continuously expand the world and spend more-and-more time simply traversing terrain to get to unexplored areas. AlmostVanilla aims to make servers still accessible and rewarding for new players, even if other players have already discovered a lot of the world.

#### **Introduce already-existing but unused features**
There are a lot of features that exist in minecraft without any way of using them in survival. AlmostVanilla aims to bring these features into survival in an intuitive and fair way.

#### **Include 'wait I thought that was already part of the game'-style features**
> Wait, can't you mine a mob spawner with silk touch?
> I thought that the dragon dropped a dragon head when it died.
> Oh, you can't craft saddles?

These are some of the kinds of things AlmostVanilla aims to bring into the game; things that make sense to many players and yet just aren't a part of vanilla survival.


### ðŸš« DON'T
#### **Create "overpowered" or "post-game" content**
AlmostVanilla is not attempting to change players' goals nor their aspirations for what to create. While these datapacks may make some previously-impossible things possible, things that could be considered "game-breaking" are avoided.

#### **Add player commands**
Players don't need to know any commands to play regular vanilla survival minecraft, so they shouldn't need to learn any to play AlmostVanilla.

#### **Add complex systems for players to learn**
Similarly, this is not a modpack that introduces a lot of new blocks and tutorials; the features in AlmostVanilla should not be more-complicated than the regular features in vanilla.
