## Insomnia
This pack allows users to opt-out of sleeping so that other players can skip the night. Players who are experiencing insomnia (as well as offline players, and players in non-overworld dimensions) are not counted towards the list of players that need to sleep to be able to skip the night.

### Enabling & Disabling Insomnia
To enable or disable insomnia, enter your bed and click either [Enable] or [Disable]. You can check if you have insomnia enabled by looking for your name in the list of players that are experiencing insomnia.
